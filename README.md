class website: https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci/203

The course covers focuses on measurement, inferential statistics and causal inference using the open-source statistics language, R. Topics in quantitative techniques include: descriptive and inferential statistics, sampling, experimental design, tests of difference, ordinary least squares regression, general linear models.

In this project, my team used statistical methods to analyze how Covid-19 spread is impacted by different levels of public mobility in the United States.

- Please refer to Final_Script_Lab2_V1.pdf and Final_Script_Lab2_V1.Rmd files for our group's (Jun Chang, Ryan Mitchell, Oliver Qian, and Lucas Schroyer) final W203 Lab 2 report and Rcode.
- The data folder includes a zip file that should be unzipped (with the outputs also locally pasted in the data folder) if a user intends to run the markdown code
- The PWD (print working directory) folder is a legacy folder that was used when developing the code. Ignore.
